            Ask for 'Water without ice'<br>-posted by Sumukh 18 min ago
            <hr>Here in the US, when you ask a restaurant employee for a glass of water, it'll almost always come with ice, regardless of the weather. So, if you do not want ice, be sure to mention that.

            Say 'Hello' or nod <br>-posted by Shreya on Feb 23 11:42
            <hr>This one is important if you wanna fit in. No matter where you are in the States, when you pass someone by or are stuck in queue by the water cooler with a stranger, it is customery to offer a polite 'How you doing?' or at least a nod. Same
            goes for leaving a place, if you buy a coffee, thank the barista and say 'Have a good one'. People aren't being excessively poilte, small talk is a part of the American culture.
